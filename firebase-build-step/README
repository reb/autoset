To execute firebase in CodeBuild it is needed to install a custom build step.

Find your PROJECT_ID by running:
```
gcloud projects list
```

Then you can choose to build the custom build step by first configuring the project:
(replace VALUE with your PROJECT_ID)
```
gcloud config set project VALUE
gcloud builds submit --config=config.yaml .
```

Or run it in one command:
gcloud builds submit --project=VALUE --config=config.yaml .
